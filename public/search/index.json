[!warning] never let the root user have any credentials! if you\u0026rsquo;re using an existing account where any credentials have been added to the root user, i strongly suggest you delete them from the root user and recreate them on iam users, and in the next part we\u0026rsquo;ll create an iam user for day to day use.\npart 3 - setting up aws organization. this service allowed you to link multiple aws accounts into a single group for easy management. while we\u0026rsquo;ll only be creating one aws account today, it\u0026rsquo;s still essential to set this up. using the search bar at the top of the page, search for and select aws organizations. choose create an organization. once again, the green banner signifies success. part 4 - setting up iam identity center. this is where you will manage all users in your aws organisation. this needs to be enabled and configured after aws organisations so that it can integrate with it. since we\u0026rsquo;re not going to be using the root user for any work, we need to create another user for this purpose. in the search bar at the top of the aws console, type iam and click on the iam identity center link that appears. [!tip] iam vs iam identity center the first two links in the screenshot above are both used to create and manage users. iam is the old way of doing this, while iam identity center is newer and recommended when creating new accounts. this tutorial will use iam identity center.\nfirst, we need to enable iam identity center in our account by clicking on enable. you\u0026rsquo;ll now end up on the homepage for iam identity centre with a green banner confirming it\u0026rsquo;s set up. we now need to give a name to our identity center instance. name it whatever you want and click save changes. you\u0026rsquo;ll now see confirmation that it\u0026rsquo;s renamed. part 5 - creating an iam user. you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use the root user for day-to-day work, so you\u0026rsquo;ll create an iam user which you\u0026rsquo;ll use to log in. now that we\u0026rsquo;ve set up the iam identity center, we can create our personal administrator user. click on users from the left of iam identity center homepage. click add user from the upper right. on the next page, do the following: 4.1. give your user a username 4.2. choose to send an email with password setup instructions 4.3. give the user an email address. i\u0026rsquo;m using gmail\u0026rsquo;s + feature to save creating a second google account for this tutorial. 4.4. set the first, last and display names. 4.5. skip the rest of the tabs and click next. choose to send an email with pnext, choose create group. this will open a new tab. ensure you keep the current tab since we\u0026rsquo;ll be returning to it once we\u0026rsquo;ve created the group. it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to not attach policies directly to users, rather it\u0026rsquo;s best to give groups permissions, and add users to that group. we\u0026rsquo;re going to create an administrators group. fill in the name and description before clicking create group. we\u0026rsquo;ll see the now familiar green banner saying we\u0026rsquo;ve successfully created our group. close the group creation tab and return to the user creation tab. click the refresh button in the upper right to cause our administrators group to appear. select it and click next. confirm the details are correct before clicking add user. once again, we\u0026rsquo;ll see a green banner telling us the user was created successfully. finally we need to give our new user some permissions. it\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to attach permissions to groups, and add users to those groups, instead of giving permissions directly to users, so that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ll do here. from the iam identity center sidebar, choose permission sets followed by create permission set. next, choose administrator access from the predefined permission sets followed by next. leave the name as it is and give it a description if you want, before clicking next. review the settings before clicking create. now we\u0026rsquo;ve created the permission set, we need to associate it with an account. from the sidebar again choose aws accounts, check the box next to the account name, and click assign users or groups. choose the administrators group we created earlier and click next. select the permission set we created earlier and click next. review your changes and click submit. the iam user is now created with administrator permissions, and before we start using it we need to set up and secure the user. part 6 - setting up and securing the iam user. before the iam user can be used, it must be configured in iam identity center and secured with mfa. when we created the user in the end of last section, an email was sent to the email address we provided inviting our user to iam identity center. go to your email, find this message and click the link that says accept invitation. choose a password, enter the confirmation and click set new password. sign in with your username and the password you just created. you\u0026rsquo;ll now be prompted to set up mfa for your iam user. [!warning] this mfa device is separate from the one you set up for the root user. you can use the same device to manage both accounts, but you need to add your iam user account separately from the root user.\nchoose authenticator app and click next. click show qr code, scan it with your app and enter the authenticator code to confirm. click done on the confirmation screen click done and you\u0026rsquo;ll appear on the aws access portal. click on administratoraccess underneath the account name to log into the account. finished and we\u0026rsquo;re done. the lessons you will have taken away from this tutorial are:\nhow aws organizations and iam identity center work together to manage the users in your organisation and what accounts they have access to. that you should never log in with the root user if there are permissions you can give an iam user. that permissions are best attached to groups instead of users. that way you can just look inside a group to see how many people have those particular permissions.
